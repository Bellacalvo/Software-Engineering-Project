# Safe Nest
## Chicken Project
The Safe Nest project is a product that is designed to scare predators away from the chickens. The safe nest uses motion detection to monitor the area around the chicken coop. When movement from a predator is detected -- such as a bear, fox, or dog, the Safe Nest will turn on a light and activate the sprinkler to scare the predator away without causing harm to them. This product is automated, easy to move, and can be quicly turned on and off when needed.
