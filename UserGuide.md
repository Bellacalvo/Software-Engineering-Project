This wiring diagram is an example of what my design looks like as it is used in the code. Pins can be adjusted as necessary.
## Motion Sensor and Water Pump
After you have finsished the set up for the motion sensor and water pump diagram make sure to check your code to ensure the pin values match the wiring. Once that is confirmed you will plug in your Arduino to your computer
using a USB-C cord. If the PIR motion sensor is not detecting anything you need to make sure that the wiring is correct. If the water pump is not turning on you need to make sure the relay is wired correctly. An indicator that the relay is working is that you will hear a clicking noise. How it is suppose to work is that once motion detector is detected the water pumpwill turn on.
