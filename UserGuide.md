# Motion Sensor and Water Pump
![circuit_image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c17e1137-6fde-4920-bb70-6049d8fcc5c4)
This wiring diagram is an example of what my design looks like as it is used in the code. Pins can be adjusted as necessary.
## Motion Sensor and Water Pump
After you have finsished the set up for the motion sensor and water pump diagram make sure to check your code to ensure the pin values match the wiring. Once that is confirmed you will plug in your Arduino to your computer
using a USB-C cord. If motion is not being connected you need to make sure that the wiring is correct as it is waht sets off the light and water pump. Same thing goes for the water pump, make sure that the wiring is correct.
How it is suppose to work is that once motion detector is detected the water pump and light will turn on.
